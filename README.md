# Krack Info
Information Regarding KRACK

## Unless a known patch has been applied, assume that all WPA2 enabled Wi-fi devices are attackable.

## Attacks that can be made (できること)
* Adversary can decrypt arbitrary packets.
* Adversary can replay broadcast and multicast frames.
* Adversary can both decrypt and inject arbitrary packets. *(TKIP or GCMP ONLY)*
* Adversary can force the client into using a predictable all-zero encryption key. *(ANDROID 6.0+ and LINUX)*

## Attacks that can not be made (できないこと)
* Adversary can not recover WPA password.
* Adversary can not inject packets. *(AES-CCMP ONLY)*
